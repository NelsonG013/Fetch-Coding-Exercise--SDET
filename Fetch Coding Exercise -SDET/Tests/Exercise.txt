This is my closest solution to the coding challenge. The test automates the process of finding the fake gold bar.

The project consist of the following components:
1. Driver Class: Sets up and tears down the WebDriver.
2. HomePage Class: Represents the web elements and actions on the challenge webpage.
3. PageInitializer Class: Initializes the HomePage object.
4. GoldBarTests Class: Contains the test method to find the fake gold bar and verify the solution.

In order to properly run the code, please install
1. Install the latest version of Visual Studio
2. Install .NET SDK
3. Install ChromeDriver and ensure it's in your system's PATH
4. Install the WebDriverManager NuGet package

To run the test:
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Restore NuGet packages.
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the tests using the Test Explorer.

I believe I was going in the right direction, sometimes my test would pass and sometimes it wouldnt. I spent a whole day on it and dont want to take more time. Aplogogies for not able to completely figure it out.
